  The Kitchen Screen module is a powerful KDS (Kitchen Display System) designed
  for restaurants. It provides a real-time kitchen display that helps staff
  manage orders efficiently, track preparation progress, and improve
  communication between the kitchen and front-of-house. With features like order
  merging, overdue alerts, and product variant identification, it streamlines
  restaurant operations and enhances service quality.
